# Hey, I'm Arty 👋

I'm a full-stack developer who gravitates toward backend systems, CLI tools, and the technical challenges that make software actually work. I enjoy building things that are efficient, well-architected, and solve real problems.

## 🛠 What I Work With

**Backend & Systems**
- Go for backend services and CLI applications
- Python for scripting and automation
- Node.js/TypeScript for full-stack applications
- SQL databases and API design

**Frontend**
- React & Next.js
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- I can build interfaces, but I really shine on the technical side

**DevOps & Systems**
- Linux & macOS system administration
- Docker & containerization
- Bash scripting & automation
- Git workflows
- System configuration and troubleshooting

## 🚀 Current Projects

**[dockerydo](https://github.com/artyultra/dockerydo)** - A lightweight Docker TUI for managing containers. Built to replace the bloated Docker Desktop experience on Linux and Mac with something fast and terminal-native.

**[tanglr](https://github.com/artyultra/tanglr)** - Exploring what social media could look like without algorithms—just chronological feeds and genuine connections.

## 💼 Open to Work

I'm interested in backend engineering, systems development, and challenging technical problems. If you're working on something interesting, let's talk.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I love working on:
- Backend systems and API architecture
- CLI tools and developer experience
- System-level problems that require deep technical understanding
- Open source projects that solve real pain points

Outside of code, you'll find me:
- Hiking, climbing, camping, or fishing
- Solving Advent of Code puzzles
- Playing Terraria, Minecraft, or story-driven adventure games
